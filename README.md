In this project we are creating a responsive website for exploring Saudi Arabia cities, 
country profile that gives you an overview of Saudi, and its events, hotels, 
restaurants, and coffee by using HTML CSS JavaScript NodeJS & mongo DB.

Dynamic Components:
User.js
Index.js
dashboardController.js
loginControllor.js
logoutController.js
registerController.js
Also we included JavaScript in most of html files .


Business Logic:
After using NodeJS we connected it to mongo DB so we can store log in & sign up information of 
the visitors of our website so when they log in again their information is already stored, also we 
added validation to make sure that the users dose not enter invalid character. When a user try to 
sign up, first we validate his email address and check if it used before if it does, the system will 
display a message that says “email already in use”.
We used interface of mongo DB instead of the terminal to manipulate the data base, also
We create schema in mongo DB that holds the following objects: username, email and password 
and it will be stored automatically to any user that register to our website.
